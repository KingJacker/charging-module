im building a voltage indicator for a single cell lipo
the leds im using use 20mA at 2 to 3 volt

the ac source in schematic is just to simulate the batteries voltage range
as for the 5v power source for the reference voltages aswell as power for the comparators im considering the TLV761

will this LM2901BIPWR ic work as the comparator?
